# express-shortcuts
A very simple [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/) library intended to speed up the coding time and reduce the file length (and therefore ending up with more readable code) in simple express projects.<br>
I don't see any reason not to use this on larger projects too if you like the simplicity, but it is designed with simple projects in mind.
## Installation
The package is aviable in the [npm registry](https://npmjs.com/package/express-shortcuts). You can install it on the command line using the following command:
```
npm i express-shortcuts
```
